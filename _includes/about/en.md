Hello. My name is Hyunkook Park, a.k.a NaLDo, and I made this blog because my head got messed up.<br>
I'm senior of my university. I thought I've done my study pretty much so far, but I don't have nothing to proof. By then, I came up with IT Blog.<br>
For now, I'll post regularly when I learn or study something.
